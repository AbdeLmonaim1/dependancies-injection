# Practical Activity No. - Dependency Injection
## Overview
This practical activity aims to demonstrate dependency injection (DI) in Java by implementing interfaces and applying different injection techniques to achieve loose coupling. It covers static instantiation, dynamic instantiation using reflection, and Spring-based DI through XML configuration and annotations. The goal is to improve flexibility, maintainability, and scalability by decoupling components. By leveraging DI, the exercise highlights best practices in software design, making the system more modular and adaptable.
